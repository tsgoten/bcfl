    Data Sufficiency:             Not enough data to generalize. [red]

Capacity Progression:             at [ 5%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 80%, 100% ]
    Ideal Machine Learner:              9,  10,  11,  12,  12,  13


Expected Accuracy:              Training            Validation
    Decision Tree:                99.26%                11.74%
    Neural Network:                 ----                  ----
    Random Forest:               100.00%                38.15%
Recommendations:
    We recommend using Random Forest -f RF.
    If predictor accuracy is insufficient, try using the effort option -e with a value of 5 or more to increase training time. 

Time to Build Estimates:
    Decision Tree:                a few seconds
